Hello! I'm Layne. I am a physical scientist interested in the assembly, organization, and dynamics of nanoscale materials and soft matter. To study these phenomena, I use statistical mechanical theory and computer simulations. Please browse this website using the headers above to learn more about my research and teaching.

**Education**

I received my Sc.B. in Chemical Physics from Brown University. I completed my undergraduate thesis on liquid crystal dynamics with Richard Stratt. Subsequently, I earned a Ph.D. in Chemistry from UC Berkeley, working with Phill Geissler to study chemical transformations of nanocrystals. From August 2020 to May 2022 I was a postdoctoral fellow at NIH with Robert Best developing tools to understand protein folding and fold-switching using models of sequence coevolution.

**Current Research**

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Mike Hagan's group at Brandeis University, where I work on understanding and controlling active matter.
